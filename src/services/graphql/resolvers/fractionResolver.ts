/**
 * GraphQL resolver for Fraction operations.
 * Handles queries for fractions and resolves related fields like metadata, orders, and sales.
 *
 * This resolver provides:
 * - Query for fetching fractions with optional filtering
 * - Field resolution for metadata associated with the fraction's claim
 * - Field resolution for marketplace orders related to the fraction
 * - Field resolution for sales history of the fraction
 *
 * Each fraction represents a portion of a hypercert, with its own unique identifiers
 * and relationships to other entities in the system.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * All resolvers follow the GraphQL best practice of returning partial data instead of throwing errors.
 * If an operation fails, it will:
 * - Log the error internally for monitoring
 * - Return null/empty data to the client
 * - Include error information in the GraphQL response errors array
 *
 * @injectable Marks the class as injectable for dependency injection with tsyringe
 * @resolver Marks the class as a GraphQL resolver for the Fraction type
